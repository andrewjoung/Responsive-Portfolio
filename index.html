                    <p> My name is Andrew Joung. I am 23 years old and I live in Bellevue, WA.
                        I love listening to music and in my free time I enjoy spending time outdoors.
                        In the spring/summer I enjoy hiking, camping, golfing, playing pickle ball, and spending time with my friends.
                        I am always down to grab a beer outside at a nice brewery.
                        In the winter I try to spend as much time as I can up in the mountains snowboarding.</p>

                    <p> I attended the University of Washington for a while where I studied Informatics which is where my journey as a developer started.
                        I have background in front-end development, Java, basic computer science logic including algorithms and data structures, as well as 
                        a little bit of Android development. </p>
                    
                    <p> During this last year, I lived in Korea for 6 months teaching English which really challenged me to step out of my comfort zone.
                        As I became ready to return back to seattle, I spent 2 weeks traveling alone in Thailand.
